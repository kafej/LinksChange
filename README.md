LinksChange
===========

Simple auto-links from text function

		This is only an example. You can create maximum 2 links per class with this method !!

		This is due to the fact that I created this function for other purpose.

		This function will change " link::something.com//" with "< a href="http://something.com">something.com< /a>"


		You need to write " link::" with space before it and you need to end link with "//"
